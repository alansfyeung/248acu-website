# What is cadets?

Army Cadets is Australia's leading youth development activity, fostering skills and leadership aligned with Army and Defence values. The Australian Army Cadets (AAC) is one of three services in the Australian Defence Force Cadets (ADFC). Over 18,000 young men and young women are in the Army Cadets, all across Australia.

# What activities do cadets do? 

The Australian Army Cadets (AAC) program allows youth to undertake core military-like activities such as navigation, drill, first aid, field craft, radio communications, survival techniques and safety. Cadets can also elect to participate in activities such as abseiling, watermanship and archery.

Army Cadets are provided with excellent opportunities to develop individual self-esteem, leadership, initiative, and problem solving in a safe, challenging and fun environment. Also, Army Cadets are encouraged to embrace the values learned in the AAC and apply them to their everyday lives in order to be better citizens. Our core values are: Service, Courage, Respect, Integrity and Excellence. 

## Training and commitment 

Our training program follows the Cadet Development Curriculum, and through regular attendance (and a few assessments), cadets become eligible for increasing recognition, starting with the completion of the C1A Cadet Recruit course. 

## Promotion up the ranks

During the course of their cadet "careers", cadets will become eligible for promotion. Promotion is exciting, but it does come with leadership responsibilities! Except for Cadet Lance Corporal (CDTLCPL), all ranks require the completion of a week-long Promotion Course in order to qualify for promotion. The highest rank that cadets can reach is Cadet Under Officer (CUO). [Find out more about cadet ranks]({% link _pages/ranks-and-promotion.md %}).

## Insignia and colours

The insignia of the Australian Army Cadets is the the torch and the sword, with the torch symbolising our youth members "lighting the way", and the sword for strength and courage. Our badge contains the torch and sword, crossed upon a wreath, with a Rising Sun crest symbolising our connection to the Australian Army. 

Our corps colours are blue and gold. On our uniform, we wear the blue shoulder patch (often called a "flash" or a "biscuit") with embroidered gold thread, that incorporates the torch, sword and Rising Sun. Fun fact: When worn on our uniform, the sword on the shoulder patch always points to the advance!

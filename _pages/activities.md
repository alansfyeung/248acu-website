Generally, we do not publicly publish specific activity dates, to protect the privacy and safety of our cadet participants. 

For some activities where we welcome the general public to attend, we'll post beforehand on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/248acu) with dates and details. 

## Bivouac Weekends

Field activities in the bush are an important part of training in the Cadet Development Continuum, for cadets of all levels. We will conduct a number of weekend bivouacs throughout the year. Typically, these will be during the school term, and will run from Friday night through to Sunday afternoon (2 days, 2 nights). 

Before cadets attend a bivouac, they will need to upload a [signed consent form]({% link _pages/landing/consent-form.md %}), pay the [activity fees]({% link _pages/payments.md %}), and read and understand the instructions for the activity. 


## Annual Field Exercise

The NSW Annual Field Exercise (AFX) is generally conducted in the September-October school holidays, and is a one-week-long activity in the bush. 

Before cadets attend AFX, they will need to upload a [signed consent form]({% link _pages/landing/consent-form.md %}), and read and understand the instructions for the activity. 

## Basic Training Weekend

Each cadet recruit, upon joining 248 ACU, will be required to attend a weekend "basic training" overnight activity, to be issued uniforms and learn basic drill and behaviours. This activity will occur some time around 3-6 weeks after their initial attendance date. Attendance at Basic Training Weekend is compulsory for new recruits. 

## Anzac Day and Remembrance Day

On commemorative occasions, cadets regularly perform a representational role in the community, including marching in the City of Sydney Anzac Day parade, and mounting catafalque parties for Dawn Services and other remembrance events. 


## Open Day

We will conduct Open Days throughout the year, usually at the beginning of a school term, so that prospective new cadets and their families can learn about 248 ACU and what we do in cadets.

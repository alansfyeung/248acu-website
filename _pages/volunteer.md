The Australian Army Cadets is a community-based organisation that is run by adult volunteers. Taking up a uniformed position (Army Cadet Staff) or non-uniformed position (Defence Approved Helpers) are both ways in which you can help and contribute to the cadets' experience. 

Roles are part-time, and our staff members come from diverse backgrounds â€“ including parents, school teachers, emergency services, ex-ADF members, professionals, ex-cadets, and many more.

### Army Cadet Staff - Officers of Cadets

Army Cadet Staff, also known as Officers of Cadets (OOCs) are dressed in uniform, wear a [badge of rank](http://localhost:4000/ranks-in-the-aac/#officers-of-cadets-ooc-ranks) that reflects their role, and may claim Cadet Volunteer Payment. 

At 248 ACU, roles for Officers of Cadets include: 

- The __Officer Commanding__, who leads the cadet unit, 
- The __Training Officer__, who develops and runs training for cadets, 
- The __Administration Officer__, who handles cadet enrolment, communications and other operational needs,
- The __Quartermaster__, who oversees the uniforms, stores and equipment, 
- And Trainee Officers of Cadets who are undertaking training 


### Defence Approved Helpers

Would you like to volunteer, but you only have a limited amount of time available? Consider becoming a __Defence Approved Helper (DAH)__. 
DAHs assist on activities such as weekend exercises and open days, as drivers, cooks, stores keepers and more, helping to ensure that cadet activities run smoothly. 

### Australian Defence Force

Volunteers in the Army Cadets are not members of the Australian Defence Force by virtue of their involvement in the AAC ([read more]({{site.data.links.aac_volunteer_url}}){:target="_blank"}).

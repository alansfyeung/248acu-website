The Australian Army Cadets is a community-based organisation that is run by volunteers. Uniformed positions (Officers of Cadets) and non-uniformed positions (Defence Approved Helpers) are both ways in which you can help 248 ACU and contribute to the cadets' experience. 

Roles are part-time, and our staff members come from incredibly diverse backgrounds â€“ parents, school teachers, emergency services, ex-ADF members, professionals, ex-cadets, and many more. 

Find our more about the [requirements for adult volunteers]({{site.data.links.aac_volunteer_url}}), and apply when you're ready!

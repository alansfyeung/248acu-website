Badges of rank in the Australian Army Cadets (AAC) closely follow those of the Australian Army, with a few exceptions. On modern uniforms, rank is worn on a "slide" positioned on the chest. Army Cadet rank slides all include a blue ribbon, with either "AAC" or "ARMY CADETS" embroidered in gold thread, to distinguish Army Cadet ranks from Army ranks.

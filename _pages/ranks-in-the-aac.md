Badges of rank in the Australian Army Cadets (AAC) closely follow those of the Australian Army, with a few exceptions. On modern uniforms, rank is worn on a "slide" positioned on the chest. Army Cadet rank slides all include a blue ribbon, with either "AAC" or "ARMY CADETS" embroidered in gold thread, to distinguish Army Cadet ranks from Army ranks.

## Cadet Ranks

Cadets start at the rank of cadet recruit, and may be promoted through the ranks listed below. AAC cadet ranks are always prefixed with the word "Cadet" (or "CDT" when abbreviated) in order to distinguish from the Australian Army equivalent. When promoted, cadets generally progress through the NCO ranks, and as senior cadets the final rank obtained is often Cadet Warrant Officer or Cadet Under Officer. 

### Cadet (CDT)/Cadet Recruit (CDTREC)

{% capture caption_cdt %}
Cadet Recruits and Cadets do not wear a rank slide (as opposed Private PTE in the Australian Army, who wear a rank slide with no insignia). Upon advancement from CDTREC to CDT, the cadet is eligible to wear the Australian National Flag patch (high visibility) on the left shoulder.

## Notes

1. Some cadet units, through association with their Army foster unit or for historical reasons, may refer to their formation as (an Armoured) troop/squadron rather than (an Infantry) section/company, and thus use the terms "Troop Commander" and "Squadron Sergeant Major" respectively.
2. The rank Cadet Staff Sergeant (CDTSSGT) was phased out from the AAC in 2011. 
3. AAC regions roughly correspond with states. Notable exceptions are Queensland, which has North Queensland (NQLD) and South Queensland (SQLD) regions respectively, and NSW, which has a brigade that encompasses community-based units (CBUs) in both NSW and the ACT, and a "2nd Brigade" for SBUs. Furthermore, the RCUO rank may, in certain circumstances, be given to Senior Under Officers (SUO) of a large SBU. 
4. In the recent past, an Instructor of Cadets (IOC) was an adult cadet staff member which held an NCO or WO rank. The IOC stream was abolished in 2018, and thus all adult cadet staff members are Officers of Cadets.
5. OOCs are not to be saluted by members of the ADF. 
6. In the distant past, regional commanders were OOCs holding the rank of COL (AAC), however the present-day AAC sub-regions are commanded by a senior Army officer.

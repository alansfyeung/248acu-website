## What is the AAC Code Club?

<img src="{{'/assets/images/landing/code-club/nsw-aac-code-club-usp.png' | absolute_url}}" alt="Activity Shoulder Patch for NSW AAC Code Club" style="float: left; margin: 1em; margin-left: 0;">

For the first time, the AAC is hosting Code Club as an elective activity for cadets to participate in. As part of the AAC's evolving cyber curriculum, you'll learn to code starting from basic principles, and if you're already familiar with code, we'll get you started on more advanced projects. Not only could coding skills lead to a rewarding career in tech, the Australian Defence Force (ADF) also is getting serious about the [cyber domain](https://www.defence.gov.au/news-events/news/2024-08-09/new-era-cyber-domain){: target="_blank"}, and so it's a great time for cadets to follow that lead and upskill in code! 

![AAC Code Club projects include Python, HTML/CSS, Scratch, micro:bit, Raspberry Pi, Blender, Unity, and more]({{"/assets/images/landing/code-club/aac-code-club-projects.jpg" | absolute_url}})

## What's happening in November 2025?

In November, NSW AAC Code Club will launch as a 'pilot course', a first-time trial where cadets can try out Code Club activities. 
- You'll be able to choose Code Club pathways that interests you. 
- There will be subject matter experts to teach you the concepts, and university student volunteer code-buddies to help you solve coding problems and level up your skills.
- Hear from and ask questions to our guest speakers from NSW Police Force, University of Technology Sydney, and ADF Careers.

This November's Code Club course consists of: 
- __Session 1:__ Launch event - mandatory weekend overnight attendance - 01-02 November 2025
- __Sessions 2-4:__ Virtual coding sessions - to continue completing your pathways - 6, 13 and 20 November 2025 

Cadets who complete the Code Club pathway requirements are eligible to receive Code Club certificates, and a unique personalised identification patch.

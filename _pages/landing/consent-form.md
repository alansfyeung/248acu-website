A signed consent form is required to attend any cadet activities, such as weekend bivouacs or Tuesday night parades. 

If you have accidentally uploaded the wrong file, this can be fixed - see below.

## Where do I find my consent form?

The consent form can be found on in CadetNet, on the activity's overview page. After downloading the form, it should be filled in and signed by a parent/guardian. Then the upload button should be used to submit the consent form. __Note: All pages of the consent form must be included in the uploaded file__.

## Can I upload multiple files for the consent form?

No, you cannot. This is a limitation of the CadetNet system. If you have mistakenly only uploaded one page of the signed consent form, then follow the instructions below to remove that file, and re-upload again. 

## I've uploaded the wrong consent form

Common mistakes include uploading the wrong file, or accidentally only uploading one page instead of two. Suddenly, your "Upload" button is disabled (greyed out)! ðŸ˜¨

__To remove or delete your incorrect consent form file:__

On the Activity page, select the "My Details" tab, next to the "Overview" tab. In the "My Activity Documents" section, click the <span style="color:red">red cross</span> next to your incorrectly uploaded document. Now you'll be able to upload your signed consent form again.

A signed consent form is required to attend any cadet activities - such as weekend bivouacs or Tuesday night parades.

## Where do I find my consent form?

The consent form can be found on in CadetNet, on the activity's overview page. After downloading the form, it should be filled in and signed by a parent/guardian. Then the upload button should be used to submit the consent form.

## I've uploaded the wrong consent form

Common mistakes include uploading the wrong file, or accidentally only uploading one page instead of two. 

Suddenly, your "Upload" button is disabled (greyed out)! ðŸ˜¨

How do you delete your incorrect consent form? Don't worry, it's simple. On the Activity page, select the "My Details" tab, next to the "Overview" tab. In the "My Activity Documents" section, click the <span style="color:red">red cross</span> next to your incorrectly uploaded document. Now you'll be able to upload your signed consent form again.

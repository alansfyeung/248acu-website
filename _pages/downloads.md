## 248 ACU Emblem

The unit emblem comes in two variations, one which is outlined black-and-white, and another which has colours. It is based on the Australian Army Cadets logo, retaining elements such as the scroll and the wattle wreath. Elements unique to 248 ACU are the depiction of the anchor and the parapet, derived from the emblem of the City of Sydney Council, and the boomerang inscribed with “Gadigal”, the anglicised spelling of the name of the Aboriginal people upon whose ancestral lands the cadet unit is located. Also, the colour of the parapet is sampled from the sandstone colour of the heritage buildings located at Victoria Barracks, Sydney.

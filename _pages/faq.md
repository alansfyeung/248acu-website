## How old do I need to be to join cadets? 

You can enrol in cadets during the year that you turn 13. The maximum age for enrolment is 16. Even if you are too young right now, you may still [submit an Expression of Interest]({% link _pages/join.md %}), and we'll reserve a spot for you in 248 ACU. 

## Are cadets part of the Army? 

Although Army Cadets is closely associated with the Australian Army, cadet members are not members of the Australian Army or Australian Defence Force (ADF). Cadets is supported by the Army, which provides uniforms, training locations and other support to help cadets run great activities and have great experiences.

By joining cadets during high school, this _does not_ obligate you to join the ADF later on, although many cadets do choose to pursue a career in the defence force!

## Do you need to attend a certain high school to join cadets?

To join a community-based unit (like 248 ACU), you may attend any high school in the local area. Unlike a (private) school-based cadet unit, we don't restrict you from joining! You just need to be able to travel to Victoria Barracks, Sydney in Paddington every Tuesday night during school term. [Joining or transferring is easy]({% link _pages/join.md %}).

This is great if you attend a high school in the Inner West, Sydney CBD or Eastern Suburbs areas like Inner Sydney High School, Rose Bay Secondary College, Randwick Boys High School, Randwick Girls High School, South Sydney High School, Matraville Sports High School, Sydney Secondary College Blackwattle Bay, Alexandria Park Community School, JJ Cahill Memorial High School, Newtown High School of the Performing Arts, Dulwich High School of Visual Arts and Design, or Marrickville High School. 

If you attend a private school in Sydney, you may also join a community-based unit like 248 ACU. We welcome students from St Andrew's Cathedral School, International Grammar School, St Scholastica's College, St Vincent's College, SCEGGS Darlinghurst, Cranbrook, Ascham, Kincoppal-Rose Bay, Kambala, Reddam House, and more. 

Even if you attend a private school that already has a cadet unit, you may join 248 ACU as long as you're not part of your school's cadet unit (such as Sydney Grammar School Cadet Unit, Waverly College Cadet Unit, Newington College Cadet Unit, The Scots College Cadet Unit, Trinity Grammar School Cadet Unit, Pittwater House Cadet Unit, St Aloysius Cadet College Unit, Shore Cadet Unit, or St Catherine's).

## Do cadets need to pass a fitness standard or a medical test?

There is no fitness standard required to participate in regular cadet activities. The AAC is an inclusive organisation, and if you have a physical or medical condition (such as a disability, asthma, diabetes or more), if we can help you to manage while you participate in cadets, there is no reason why you cannot join. In your senior cadet years, some activities, such as the [Adventure Training Award](https://news.defence.gov.au/service/defining-moment-cadets-lives){:target="_blank"}, may require a certain level of fitness before participating. 

## Is cadets dangerous? 

The Australian Army Cadets (AAC) conducts activities in a positive, safe and nurturing manner. All activities and events undergo a risk-assessment procedure, and require approval from HQ. Military-experience activities such as using Army equipment, riding in Army vehciles and shooting service weapons is strictly supervised. 

Adult leaders undergo rigorous training in youth safety, are qualified to provide first aid, and hold Working With Children Checks in NSW. They provide supervision to cadets, are legally responsible for welfare, and are held to similar standards as school teachers.

## Can cadets go overseas?

Yes! When the opportunity arises, cadets from 248 ACU may attend overseas [exchange activities](https://www.facebook.com/203ACU/photos/a.374003996044265/1834504383327545/){:target=_blank}, such as going to the [United Kingdom](https://www.facebook.com/203ACU/photos/a.374003996044265/1834507163327267/){:target=_blank} and more. 

## Can I help to run cadet activities?

Our cadet unit is run by adult volunteers - Army Cadet Staff (ACS), Officers of Cadets (OOC) and Defence Approved Helpers (DAH) - who plan the operations and activities that cadets do. You need to be at least 18 years old. Our staff come from all kinds of different backgrounds! [Find out more]({% link _pages/volunteer.md %}) about volunteering in the Army Cadets.

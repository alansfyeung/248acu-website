# Attending activities

At 248 ACU we maintain a steady rhythm of cadet training, learning and military experiences throughout the year. To keep up with our fun and exciting program, regular attendance is a must.

Each year, we'll distribute a __parade card__ which is a calendar with key dates of cadet events. To avoid disappointment, be sure to record these dates down in your family diary.

Similar to school, we follow a learning and training continuum. Through attending cadet activites, cadets complete progressive "levels" of training. Whilst some activities are fun optional experiences, for most activities, attendance is compulsory.

## Parade nights 

Cadets are expected to attend every parade night, occurring weekly during the school term on Thursday nights. On parade nights, a mixture of classroom lessons and practical/physical lessons are taught to cadets. Topics vary greatly, from basics like drill, military ranks, first aid, navigation... through to advanced topics such as survival, STEM packages and leadership.

## Basic Training Weekend

Each cadet recruit, upon joining 248 ACU, will be required to attend a weekend "basic training" overnight activity, to be issued uniforms and learn basic drill and behaviours. This activity will occur some time around 3-6 weeks after their initial attendance date. Attendance at Basic Training Weekend is compulsory for new recruits. 

Before recruits attend the basic training weekend, they will need to upload a [signed consent form]({% link _pages/landing/consent-form.md %}), pay the [joining fees]({% link _pages/payments.md %}), and read and understand the instructions for the activity. 

## Bivouac Weekends (overnight camps)

At least once every half-year, cadets will attend a 2-day field activity, called a bivouac, that is out in the bush. This is often a highlight for many. Cadets will get to practise and hone their fieldcraft and outdoors skills. Attendance on these field activities is required to complete most cadet training levels. Additionally, once per year during the Sep-Oct school holidays, expect to attend a 7-day long "Annual camp" activity. 

Before cadets attend a bivouac, they will need to upload a [signed consent form]({% link _pages/landing/consent-form.md %}), pay the [activity fees]({% link _pages/payments.md %}), and read and understand the instructions for the activity. 

## Annual Field Exercise

The NSW Annual Field Exercise (AFX) is generally conducted in the September-October school holidays, and is a one-week-long activity in the bush. 

Before cadets attend AFX, they will need to upload a [signed consent form]({% link _pages/landing/consent-form.md %}), and read and understand the instructions for the activity. 

## Community and military experience activities

From time to time, cadets may volunteer or be selected to attend community events such as Anzac Day commemorations. Also from time to time, opportunities may arise to visit Army or Australian Defence Force (ADF) bases. Participation in such activities is usually optional but sometimes may be a requirement to complete certain levels of cadet training. 

## Anzac Day and Remembrance Day

On commemorative occasions, cadets regularly perform a representational role in the community, including marching in the City of Sydney Anzac Day parade, and mounting catafalque parties for Dawn Services and other remembrance events. 

## Leadership promotion courses

As cadets start to become eligible for promotion, they will be required to attend a week-long promotion course as the final "qualification" for their promotion. Promotion courses are held during the school holidays. 

## Annual Ceremonial Parade

At the end of the year in December, 248 ACU will celebrate the year's achievements by conducting a ceremonial parade. We invite family, friends and VIPs to spectate at our ceremonial parade, and it's an opportunity for outstanding cadets to be recognised with awards and promotions. 

Before cadets attend the Annual Ceremonial Parade, they will need to upload a [signed consent form]({% link _pages/landing/consent-form.md %}), and read and understand the instructions for the activity. 


## Dining In Nights

Formal dinners, conducted in a military Dining In Night tradition, are a favourite event of cadets. At 248 ACU, we usually hold a dining in night following our annual ceremonial parade. It's a relaxed and friendly atmosphere where cadets enjoy the company of their peers for the evening. 

Before cadets attend a dining in night, they will need to upload a [signed consent form]({% link _pages/landing/consent-form.md %}), pay the [activity fees]({% link _pages/payments.md %}), and read and understand the instructions for the activity. 


# Leave, sickness and non-attendance

It happens - cadets become sick, or cannot attend a certain activity because they need to study for their exams. We understand and will try to accommodate unforeseen events. When a cadet misses required training, it will be their own responsibility to organise catch-up action and self-study if needed. 

When a cadet is sick, or will be foreseeably absent, we require an email from the parent/guardian to let us know of their child's whereabouts. This process of requesting personal leave/sick leave.

We do _not_ recommend combining cadets with another highly involved commitment (for example, such as a casual/part time job, or a serious sporting commitment) as it often leads to scheduling conflicts and will affect your ability to progress through cadets. Parents are welcome to discuss these matters with the unit's officers (adult staff). 

# Costs of joining cadets

248 ACU is supported materially and in-kind by Army/ADF who provide us with equipment, facilities and certain resources. However, as with all other cadet units in Australia, we do not receive direct funding, and instead rely on fundraising to enable our training and activities to happen. 

Upon joining, cadets will pay a joining fee that consists of a uniform deposit, and some basic training incidental costs. Participating cadets are required to pay an annual fee. Also, activities such as bivouacs may incur an activity fee to recover costs such as transport and catering.

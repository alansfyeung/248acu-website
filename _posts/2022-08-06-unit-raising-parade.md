On the morning of Saturday 6th August, 2022, members of 22 Australian Army Cadet Battalion (22 AAC Bn) held a parade at Victoria Barracks, Sydney, to welcome 248 Army Cadet Unit (ACU) as the seventh unit in the cadet battalion.

The Duke of Edinburgh's banner, which is the banner of the Australian Army Cadets, was paraded, and the Australian Army Cadet Band Sydney (AACB-S) also played at this historic event. Parade participants and visitors were welcomed to country by Dr Peter Mackenzie of La Perouse, and Brigadier Wells CSC addressed the cadets, highlighting the importance of cadets and the commitment of support from Headquarters Forces Command (HQ FORCOMD) to 248 ACU.

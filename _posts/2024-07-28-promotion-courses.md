One of the most exciting aspects of cadets is being [promoted in rank]({% link _pages/ranks-in-the-aac.md %}), unlocking new experiences and leadership opportunities. To qualify for their promotion, cadets typically need to complete a course. To reach the ranks of Cadet Corporal (CDTCPL), Cadet Sergeant (CDTSGT) and Cadet Warrant Officer (CDTWO2/CDTWO1) or Cadet Under Officer (CUO), cadets are required to complete a one-week course. 

This July, during school holidays, six of our cadets attended and successfully completed their respective courses.

**Cadet Sergeant Bella Seeto:**
I got the opportunity to go on the CWC Course within the July holidays to equip myself with the mindset and knowledge to help at 248 ACU as a senior leader. This was the last leadership course I will get to complete as a cadet, and it was by far my favourite, because of the engaging lessons and enthusiastic instructors and candidates who perpetuated an active, exciting atmosphere throughout the week. Within this course I enjoyed learning sword, cane and banner drill which we will all take back to our units to teach for our [Annual Parade]({% link _posts/2023/2023-12-23-2023-annual-awards-promotions.md %}) at the end of the year. This course was beneficial as it furthered my knowledge of what goes on behind the scenes within a unit and practice leadership among others, as well as work on eliminating ‘cadetisms’ within the AAC. I loved meeting new friends and reunite with friends from past courses, together learning and making memories throughout the week. Now I am ready to further help out at my unit with the knowledge, skills and mindset this course equipped me with.

**Cadet Corporal Billy Clare:**
I enjoyed the July promotion courses up in Singleton Military Area during the school holidays, it was a great opportunity to meet new people from across the NSW brigade, and also broaden my leadership skills within a cadet environment. In particular, my favourite part of the sergeant’s course was doing Steyr drill. Overall, I’d say that my experience on the course, coupled with my prior experiences on promotion courses was overwhelmingly positive, and has provided me with the skills necessary to become a better leader within cadets. 

**Cadet Lance Corporal Conrad Field:**
For me, the course was an enjoyable course and a once-in-a-lifetime experience, we first went to Singleton Barracks and checked in. After checking in we went to our cabins which I met my roommates. They made my experience of the course more easier and enjoyable. Although the course was hard, we did have fun - one example is, after about 2 days, we started to praise a stick which, I thought was funny - even the ACS joined in. But my favourite part about the course was [during personal administration down time], because of all the people I got to meet who were from all around New South Wales.

CDT Kennedy: It was great to see all different types of people buying items from us. Everyone was nice and some people stopped to take a selfie. Many came up and told us stories, ranging from someone who was a former Infantry Sergeant, through to a lady whose late husband was in the defence force.

CDT Crane: We were really happy to raise a large amount of money 
(Seeto and her) raised over $1k of the total, positioned at Town Hall near the Light Rail stop. 
Met a guy who was formerly a Captain in the Indian Army and he purchased a $50.00 pin.

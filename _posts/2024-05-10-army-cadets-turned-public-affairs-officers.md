During the April School holidays, two of our very own cadets from 248 ACU were given the opportunity to attend a Public Affairs One & Two course, where they developed advanced public affairs skills alongside 140 Navy Cadets attending Fleet Engagements Camp (FEC) 2024. From sleeping overnight on HMAS Canberra to riding around Sydney Harbour with the NSW Water Police, it's safe to say these cadets have had some wonderful experiences. With the help of the cadets’ new-found photography skills, everybody will be able to share in the memories.

From 12 - 19 April 2024, Cadet Lance Corporal Conrad Field and Cadet Lance Corporal Sheba Perry from 248 ACU attended the course with 16 other Navy and Army cadets from across Australia. The course began at Glenbrook RAAF Base, then moved on to Cockatoo Island in Sydney Harbour where it was held in conjunction with Fleet Engagement Camp (FEC) 2024.

“It was a very rare opportunity to learn so much, and be able to bring the skills I gained from the course back to help my unit,” said CDTLCPL Field.
“The more time I spent on the course, the more I learned from great people.”

Throughout the week, cadets learnt many useful public affairs skills that they could then use to promote their cadet unit and share the Australian Cadet experience effectively. The cadets began with basic photography and photo captioning, then they learned how to use a camera manually, how to take videos, how to use video editing software to create a video compilation, how to conduct an interview, and how to write articles and social media posts.

These skills were taught through camera teams where cadets could learn the value of teamwork and respect while documenting the activities that Navy Cadets were partaking in during FEC.

“I feel very privileged to have attended the course,” said CDTLCPL Perry. “I met so many new people and learnt skills that I will be able to use for the rest of my life.”

By the end of the week, the now capable public affairs officers could return to their units with some of their work making its way onto social media, a cadet's article being published, and one cadet receiving a specialist promotion.

From 28 September - 4 October 2024, 21 cadets and three Army Cadet Staff from 248 ACU attended the NSW AAC Brigade Annual Field Exercise (AFX) 2024 at Singleton Training Area, among 1200 other Army and Air Force Cadets. 
The 7-day annual exercise was a first-time experience for many of our ACU’s cadets and held a variety of activities for them to consolidate skills of their cadet training in a field environment. Some notable exercises include a live fire of the EF88 Austeyr rifle, a visit to the Australian Army Infantry Museum, a guide of numerous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) by members of the 9th Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, a team-based run of the Lone-Pine Barracks obstacle course guided by Army Physical Training Instructors, and a brigade-wide parade led by NSW BDE Commander Colonel Andrew White and Regional CUO Tori Garnsey, all made possible by the officers, volunteers, and assisting ADF personnel who worked tirelessly throughout the week.

“My favourite activity was the obstacle course because I liked experiencing what an infantry soldier would do during training,” said Cadet Lance Corporal Daniel Matkovich, ‘the obstacles were challenging but really fun.”

Alongside the other units of 22 Battalion, our cadets engaged in exercises to develop skills in navigation, radio telecommunication, cam and concealment, fieldcraft, and teamwork. The battalion was divided into Alpha Company and Beta Company, who faced off in a series of stealth operations to gather intelligence on their respective opposition and ended with a high-stakes game of capture the flag resulting in Alpha Company’s victory. Among sections, platoons, and companies of 22 BN, leadership positions were filled by 248 ACUs committed NCOs and Cadet Officers. 

“AFX 2024 showed me the importance of teamwork, morale and leadership,” said Cadet Under Officer Bella Seeto, Company Commander at 248 ACU. “As part of the Beta Company Command team, I recognised how our collaborative work ensured cadets were all engaged and enthusiastic with the AFX storyline. I really enjoyed and valued the experience that we all got to have”.

A highlight of the exercise for many cadets was the live shoot of the Army’s EF88 Austeyr rifle at the Marksmanship Training Range in Singleton Training Area. Thanks to the soldiers and officers of the 4th/3rd Battalion, Royal NSW Regiments who instructed and oversaw the activity, everyone had a safe and enjoyable time at the range. It was definitely an exciting point of discussion on the bus ride home.

Cadets could also take part in barrier qualifications for upcoming national exercises, the Deputy Chief of Army Adventure Training Award (ATA) and Chief of Army Cadet Team Challenge (CACTC), measured through physical endurance during a pack march, beep test and swim test.

NSW AAC BDE AFX2024 was a great success for 248 ACU. Whether it was some cadet's first or last AFX, it's certain that everyone enjoyed the activity thoroughly and next year's AFX is in eager anticipation.

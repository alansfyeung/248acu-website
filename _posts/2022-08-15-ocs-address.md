My name is Captain (AAC) Alan Yeung and I am the Officer Commanding, 248 Army Cadet Unit. 248 Army Cadet Unit is, at time of writing, the newest cadet unit in Australia. Situated at Victoria Barracks, Sydney, a location with significant military history, it is a fitting place to raise a community-based cadet unit. Strong support from Headquarters Forces Command has enabled the cadet unit to commence operating with its first intake of new recruits. I look forward to the growth of 248 ACU and establishing coimmunity-based Army Cadets as a leading option for high school students seeking an extra-curricular, self-development activity.

During the remainder of 2022, my intent is to develop a strong operating rhythm, and reach out to foster relationships within the Inner Sydney, Inner West and Eastern Suburbs communities. Our initial interactions with RSL sub-branches and high schools in the area have been promising.  

Our first recruit intake is on track to complete the majority of the C1A cadet recruit course by the end of this year, leading to a fresh enrolment in early 2023 that I hope will encompass students from even more local high schools. The journey for members of 248 Army Cadet Unit has just begun. Please reach out to the cadet unit if you have any enquiries.

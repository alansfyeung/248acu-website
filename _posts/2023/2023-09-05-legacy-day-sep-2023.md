248 ACU recently participated in fundraising activities for Legacy Week 2023, selling on Saturday in Sydney's Town Hall area.

During the day, cadets from 248 ACU sold badges, pens and toys. One of the cadets participating was CDT Kennedy. "It was great to have people of many different backgrounds buying items from us", they said. "Everyone was nice, and some people stopped to take a selfie. Others came up to us and told us stories, including someone who was a former Infantry Sergeant, and also a lady whose [late] husband was in the Defence force."

Another cadet, CDT Crane, conducted fundraising around the busy street junctions of Town Hall. "[CDTCPL Seeto and I] were really happy to raise a large amount of money, and as a team we collected over $1,000", she said.

During the day, cadets from 248 ACU raised over $3,000.00 to support Defence veterans and their families.
